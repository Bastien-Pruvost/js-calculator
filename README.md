# JS - Calculator

A simple calculator in JavaScript

[calculator.pruvostbastien.fr](https://calculator.pruvostbastien.fr)


## About the project

A JS project to practice.

I integrate a calculation function from the last result (depending on whether the user presses a number or an operator after his last calculation the calculator knows if he wants to do a new calculation or calculate from the last result).

I also integrated a management of the number of decimal places. When rounding, the number of decimal places is calculated based on the space available on display.


## Features

- Calculation from the last result
- Number of decimal based on available space
